Let's do something with animations !

how about some 2d physics?

how about you both do an episode where brooks builds a backend and CJ the frontend

You should do a code wars battle against each other.

Hey, CJ, how about coding a chrome extension??

To that guy who suggested to make a Chrome Extension, Firefox Extensions actually have better docs so I think that'd be easier

A search feature may be useful for chat manager

What about simple language processing to promote messages depending on sentiment?
